## Currently Supported Interactions
### The user can pause the grid.
   This interaction is mostly allows for examining the grid closely without it changing. It helps the user undestand where each cluster is and they can also learn to anticipate certain clusters to stabilize and others to grow out of control.
   
### The user can create a cell by clicking on an empty space on the grid.
  
  Being able to manipulate the board is an important power to give to the user because the user can determine the entire course of the simulation by merely adding one cell that will make a stabilized cluster grow exponentially. It will also help the user understand some of the life/death rules, say, if they decide to create an isolated cell and see it die.
  
### The user can kill a cell by clicking on it.
  
  This allows for the user to manually stabilize clusters and create a habitat that will last and stabilize.
  
### The user can clear the grid completely.
 
  Killing all cells allows the user to start over by manually creating clusters as opposed to the randomized initialization. This is more effective if the user pauses before creating any new cells.
  
### The user can reset the board and get a new random set of initial cells.
 
  Revisiting the simulation several times helps greatly with understanding patterns and figuring out the logic behind what makes cells die, get born or survive. 
  
## Suggested Improvements to Interaction
### Key/Mouse Guide
There should be a visible table on the visualization that has the key/mouse instructions on how to interact with the grid.
As the person who created the visualization, I know every part of it. A user who has never seen it before can not anticipate any interaction without proper documentation and guidance. The biggest change I would make is to inform the user on how to interact with the grid by giving them that information. I would even suggest the creation of a main page where one can first read about what the visualization is depicting and a guide on how to use the functionality effectively. The guide would cover the basics like what each key or mouse button does and explain how they can be used together. An example is to clear the grid and then create a few clusters while paused to see the outcome. I came across this problem when I showed a friend proudly what I had accomplished and they had no understanding of what they were even looking at and did not know it was interactive.
