### Currently Supported Interactions
=> The user can pause the grid.
   This interaction is mostly allows for examining the grid closely without it changing. It helps the user undestand where each cluster is and they can also learn to anticipate certain clusters to stabilize and others to grow out of control.
   
=> The user can create a cell by clicking on an empty space on the grid.
  Being able to manipulate the board is an important power to give to the user because the user can determine the entire course of the simulation by merely adding one cell that will make a stabilized cluster grow exponentially. It will also help the user understand some of the life/death rules, say, if they decide to create an isolated cell and see it die.
  
=> The user can kill a cell by clicking on it.
  This allows for the user to manually stabilize clusters and create a habitat that will last and stabilize.
  
=> The user can clear the grid completely.
  Killing all cells allows the user to start over by manually creating clusters as opposed to the randomized initialization. This is more effective if the user pauses before creating any new cells.
  
=> The user can reset the board and get a new random set of initial cells.
  Revisiting the simulation several times helps greatly with understanding patterns and figuring out the logic behind what makes cells die, get born or survive.
